# Landing pages

Landing pages need to develop rapidly and need to access by large customers in a short time. That means we can't put them in php web app environment. The only place where we can put them is CDN, so they have to be 
static files.

If putting landing pages in PHP environment, the high concurrent access to these pages will not only be unavailable but also occupy other resources in PHP space, making the entire PHP environment unavailable.
