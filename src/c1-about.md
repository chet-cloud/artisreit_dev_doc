Artis Reit Documents is a website where developers can introduce, explain and share the specifications in developments. This website is powered by mdbook.


### Mdbook
mdBook is a command line tool to create books with Markdown. It is ideal for creating product or API documentation, tutorials, course materials or anything that requires a clean, easily navigable and customizable presentation.
