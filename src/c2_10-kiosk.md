### Solution

![kiosk](./images/kiosk_v0.0.1.png)


### Explaining

1. LG TV support "TV WALL" - combined TVs as one screen display one signal line from one tiny pc

2. Kiosk mode
    - Tiny pc, installed window 10 pro, supports [kiosk mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/setup-digital-signage)

3. Nginx service
    - Nginx, stylized as NGIÐ˜X, is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache
    - [Win-nginx-service](https://github.com/chet-cloud/win-nginx-service) - running nginx as a service in window
    - When extending the project, the Nginx reverse proxy can be used to connect the services in Azure.
    - High available but require very little CPU and memory resource

4. Local files
    - Local files in C:/Sync is a repo, cloned from github - [300main_kiosk_static](https://github.com/chet-cloud/300main_kiosk_static)

5. LogMeIn
    - Is a remote manager service from IT team
    - Used to remote update local files or other maintain working
    - Press `normal reboot` button in LogMeIn to restart tiny pc 


### Deployment

1. Install nginx
    - install nginx serivce according to the readme in [Win-nginx-service](https://github.com/chet-cloud/win-nginx-service)
    - set the content directory in C:\nginx\conf
    ```shell
        server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  localhost;
        location / {
            root   C:/Sync;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }

    ```

2. Setup kiosk user

    ![kiosk_setup](./images/kiosk_setup.png)
    - Kiosk mode - as a digital sign or interactive display
    - website URL - localhost/index.html#left, localhost/index.html#right or localhost/index.html#center 
    - #left, #right or #center as the param pass to determine which page will be displayed
    - every 24 hours restart the browser

3. Install LogMeIn
    - ![logmein](./images/logmein.png)

### Content Update

1. Update resource files

    - 100M is the max file that can be upload to github, so update the html, css, and js to [300main_kiosk_static](https://github.com/chet-cloud/300main_kiosk_static)
    - copy images and videos to the directory (c:/Sync) in tiny pcs

2. Pull from github

    - go to c:/Sync and run `git pull`
    - update the config file in `core/version.center.json`, `core/version.center.json` or `core/version.center.json`, the browser page will update with new content
